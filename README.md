# chatgpt-web
a website made by chatgpt and for GPT3. Try it [here](https://wikinana.org/chat/)

### How does it work? ###
  - You need to first obtain an openai API key. 
  - download these files, upload it to your website. 
  - Modify chatgpt.php, and put in your api key there. (is this a safe thing to do?)
